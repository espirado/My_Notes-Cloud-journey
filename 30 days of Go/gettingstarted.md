Concurrency in Go is the ability for functions to run independent of each other.

Scope of Golang Variables Defined by Brace Brackets
Golang uses lexical scoping based on code blocks to determine the scope of variables. Inner block can access its outer block defined variables, but outer block cannot access inner block defined variables.



A constant is a name or an identifier for a fixed value. The value of a variable can vary, but the value of a constant must remain constant.

Go is a statically typed programming language. This means that variables always have a specific type and that type cannot change. The keyword var is used for declaring variables of a particular data type.
